SPECIFICATIONS:
This program prompts a user for two polynomials. It implements a polynomial ADT that manipulates non-negative exponent polynomials in a single variable x. The ADT will includes the following operations: 
Add the two polynomials.                         
Get the highest degree of the polynomials.       
Get the coefficient for the x-power term.        
Change the coefficient of a term.                
Multiply a polynomial by a scalar.

ONE SAMPLE RUN OF ADDITION ON THE TWO POLYNOMIALS:

Let's enter your first polynomial! You must enter the info for the higher power terms first. Scalars will be entered last.

How many terms will your polynomial have?  3
Will the polynomial contain a constant? Enter y for yes, n for no:  n
What's the highest power of the polynomial?  3
What's the coefficient of that power? 2
What's the next highest power? 2
What's the coefficient of that power? 4
What's the next highest power? 1
What's the coefficient of that power? 1
You entered:  2x^3 + 4x^2 + x

Let's enter your second polynomial! You must enter the info for the higher power terms first. Scalars will be entered last.

How many terms will your polynomial have?  2
Will the polynomial contain a constant? Enter y for yes, n for no:  y
What's the highest power of the polynomial?  7
What's the coefficient of the highest power term? 4
Enter the scalar constant:  3
You entered:  4x^7 + 3

Now that you've entered your polynomials, Would you like to see a set of possible operations? Enter y for yes, n for no: 
y

Enter a number from the following options: 
Add the two polynomials.                         1
Get the highest degree of the polynomials.       2
Get the coefficient for the x-power term.        3
Change the coefficient of a term.                4
Multiply a polynomial by a scalar.               5
1

Adding your polynomials results in:  4x^7 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 3
Would you like to see a list of possible operations? Enter y for yes, n to exit: 
n
