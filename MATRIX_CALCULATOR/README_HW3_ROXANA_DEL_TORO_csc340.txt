HW3 Q2: MATRIX
Readme-Results: IMPORTANT: I used Netbeans to compile and run both programs.Roxana del ToroMarch 2, 2014CSC 340: Prof. YangSID: 913645868email: rxdeltoro@gmail.com

Q2 SPECIFICATIONS: This program uses square matrices only. The program can add or multiply two matrices by forming a third matrix. It can also multiply a matrix by a scalar, and it can transpose a matrix. This program uses an ADT and separate compilation. TWO sample runs are included below, one of addition, and one of matrix multiplication.

********************************************************************************************
SAMPLE RUN OF ADDITION OPTION:

Enter an integer for the # of rows/columns:  3
Enter integers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

The matrix is: 
   1   2   3
   1   2   3
   1   2   3
Which of the following options would you like to do? 
______________________________________________________
  1 :  Take the matrix you just created and add it to a new matrix of the same size. 
  2 :  Take the matrix you just created and multiply it with a new matrix of the same size. 
  3 :  Multiply the matrix by a scalar. 
  4 :  Transpose the matrix. 
       Enter a number for your option or -1 to exit:  1

For the second matrix, enter integers separated by spaces: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 22 

The matrix is: 
   2   2   2
   2   2   2
   2   2   2
And after addition... 
The matrix is: 
   3   4   5
   3   4   5
   3   4   5
RUN FINISHED; exit value 0; real time: 14s; user: 0ms; system: 0ms

**********************************************************************************
SAMPLE RUN OF MULTIPLICATION OF TWO MATRICES

Enter an integer for the # of rows/columns:  2
Enter integers separated by spaces: 8 9 8 9

The matrix is: 
   8   9
   8   9
Which of the following options would you like to do? 
______________________________________________________
  1 :  Take the matrix you just created and add it to a new matrix of the same size. 
  2 :  Take the matrix you just created and multiply it with a new matrix of the same size. 
  3 :  Multiply the matrix by a scalar. 
  4 :  Transpose the matrix. 
       Enter a number for your option or -1 to exit:  2

For the second matrix, enter integers separated by spaces: 1 2 1 2

The matrix is: 
   1   2
   1   2
And after multiplication... 
  17  34
  17  34

RUN FINISHED; exit value 0; real time: 25s; user: 0ms; system: 0ms
