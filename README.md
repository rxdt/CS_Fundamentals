<h3>CS_Fundamentals in C++</h3>
<h4>A sampling of programs written in C++ that demonstrate an understanding of CS fundamentals.</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>EXCEPTIONS</strong></li>	
Tests an item against an array and returns the ID number if the item is contained in the array 
and throws an exception if the item is not found.

<li><strong>MATRIX CALCULATOR</strong></li>
A calculator for square matrices that can add or multiply two matrices to form a 3rd matrix, multiply a matrix by a scalar, or transpose a matrix.

<li><strong>POLYNOMIAL CALCULATOR</strong></li>
A single-variable non-negative exponent polynomial calculator. It gets the highest degree of the polynomials, the coefficient for, can change the coefficient of a term, or can multiply a polynomial by a scalar.          

<li><strong>PROSE TEXT</strong></li>
Takes user input as a string of raw English prose and returns a list of each unique word and the count of each word.

<li><strong>SORTING</strong></li>
Has a user create a vector of doubles. A deep copy of the vector is then sorted with selection sort. The original vector values are then sorted using insertion sort.
</ul>
